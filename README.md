Does your physics homework for you!

I wrote this during senior year of high school (March 23, 2009) to do my physics homework for me because I was tired of solving the same tedious problems over and over again. I told my teacher about it and the other students accused me of cheating. The teacher responded by saying "well he obviously had to understand physics to program this, so it seems okay to me". She was the best teacher ever.
